Episodes are then grouped into ordered \"phases\" within \"sequences\", where a sequence is like a subplot. It's not entirely clear from the description but I think episodes within a phase are assumed to be mutually exclusive; for example, in a sequence about assassinating someone, one phase might have episodes for attempts at their office and at their home (assuming you wouldn't do both). Sequences have further logical groupings for overall story flow (beginning and ending sequences) and variety in the midgame (different characters have different sequence groups so scenes alternative their focus).\n\n!img http://i.imgur.com/E8YvkOVl.jpg Title cards typically mark the beginning of sequences.\n\nWhich scene plays at any given time is selected by a process called \"Narraton\". Narraton selects episodes, not sequences; sequences are used to enforce ordering but don't have conditions of their own. Narraton selects episodes by comparing certain global variables that range from 0 to 100 to per-episode requirements using a least-squares fit; Doug's talk goes in to more detail on this, but basically it means that scenes are loosely coupled, preserving logical connections without ever using explicit linking. At its best this made adding content easy:\n\n> A big advantage of using an episode selector rather than a more explicit type of branching was that it let me improvise more freely.

Naver Matome is the ultimate expression of this - a post is just a series of sections, where each section is a link, a quote, an image, or one of several other types. Other familiar examples are Tumblr blogs (where each post has a multimedia type) or the Medium editor.\nSome of these list editors focus heavily on simply collecting existing content; examples include the ill-fated Delicious stacks, Streme, and Pinterest. Others emphasize stringing together documents from multiple sources as part of illustrating a larger story; examples include Matome, Storify and its many clones, and Togetter (Japanese, Twitter focused). Many of these sites describe themselves as \"curation\" services.\nThere are open-source tools for making editors like this as well, such as Sir Trevor. The Smallest Federated Wiki uses a JSON format based around typed blocks. Jupyter (formerly the iPython notebook) also uses typed blocks in their editor, though the blocks are mainly not-code (Markdown/HTML), code, and code output rather than being multimedia-oriented.\nLists of content as a kind of artifact of their own reminds me of the concept of \"trails\" from As We May Think, particularly as described in section 7:\n\nThe owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.\n\nΨ\n"}

It's in 3D and thus emphasizes the overall mansion layout more than facades; the gardens are particularly lovely.\n\n\nUpdate 2015-11-17: It turns out that in 1992 there was a whole book written about generating Palladian Villas! Possible Palladian Villas is easy to find for sale. It even included software you could use, though unfortunately I haven't been able to find that for sale anywhere. There is this review though, which includes some screenshots (including the one above). Ψ\n"}

On top of that, the note is shown shortly after and appears to be written with a fountain pen:\n\n!img http://i.imgur.com/l52Wyjil.jpg\n\nOf course since it's a movie there's no reason to believe this is the card actually written in the scene, but then again why bother using a different pen altogether?\n\n!img http://i.imgur.com/0e7SN4tl.jpg\n\nPilot [claims](http://www.pilot.co.jp/products/pen/fountain/fountain/capless_raden/) their \"Vanishing Point\" or \"Capless\" line, released in 1963, was the first click fountain pen ever released, though the earlier [Asterope](http://www.fountainpen.it/Asterope) (1934) and [Meteore Pullman](http://www.fountainpen.it/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9ore/en) (1932) were similar in many respects. In any case all of these are far too late to be showing up in a 1922 silent film.\n\nWhile not click-based, there were Japanese pens released in the 20s under the name \"Capless\" - apparently unrelated to Pilot's later development - that had a retractable nib and could be operated with one hand. Information about them is very scarce, though - all I've found is [one forum thread](http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/54239-real-mysterious-vintage-capless-pens-from-japan/) and [one series of Japanese blog posts](http://ameblo.jp/kamisama-samasama/entry-11656545570.html). As the Japanese blog posts explain, the date on their patent is Taisho 12 or 1924, so even that's too late unless some were produced while the patent was being processed. \n\nLeaving aside the click fountain pens, pens with retracting nibs were actually common in the 1920s in the form of [\"safety\" pens](http://www.vintagepens.com/safety_pens.shtml) designed with an emphasis on preventing leakage. However, the point of the retracting nib was to allow you to drop ink straight into the barrel, so if one of those pens had the cap off and nib retracted in your pocket all the ink would just spill out. Additionally, most of them required twisting to extend the nib - not something you'd do with one hand.\n\nThere is another familiar writing instrument that clicks and doesn't use caps - mechanical pencils. However, in the 1920s mechanical pencils were still ordinarily operated by turning the cap or nose - Eversharp, one of the major brands, didn't release a clicking pencil [until 1936](http://www.penhero.com/PenGallery/Eversharp/WahlEversharpPencils.htm).\n\nButton-action pencils intended primarily for drafting were available [as early as 1879](http://leadholder.com/lh-non-eagle.html), but the first models weren't \"propellers\" - clicking didn't advance lead slightly, it just let it go completely, so you had to get the length right [by aligning it on a writing surface](http://leadheadpencils.blogspot.jp/2012/02/eagle-week-part-1-stop-gauge-pencils.html).

I haven't had it - no matter how good it is I'm not sure abura soba would stay tasty as instant food - but if you can't get out to the shop it may be worth keeping an eye out. Ψ\n"}

While generally I've been happy with it there have been some issues.\n\n## The Flashlight\n\nHaving a built-in flashlight feature is great, but as I found out the first time I used it doesn't work as a reading light in a pinch. After about a minute it goes off and won't go back on without rebooting the phone. Around October 2015 I thought this was fixed, but it happened again November 5. It may have something to do with rotating the phone with the light on.\n\n## The Google Loop\n\nOne day I woke up and picked up my phone and it turned off mysteriously. Plugging it in to its charger it turned on, rumbled, showed the Google logo, and turned off again. It then did the same thing repeatedly for over ten minutes. Looking around online this appears to be an issue where the part of the power switch inside the phone gets physically jammed. You can fix it by stroking the switch top to bottom, flicking it with your finger, or smacking the phone (not too hard). I managed to get it working again and after a few issues over the next day or two it's been fine, but this was worrying.\n\n## Wifi Connection Issues\n\nFor a long time I felt like my phone didn't perform as well on my home wifi as it did on mobile data - browsing the internet DNS would fail to resolve, or on Twitter images or profiles would fail to load. Looking around it seems that some wifi \"channels\" aren't actually supported very well - I'd never heard of this happening, but by changing my router's settings I was able to get it working. For a 2.4GHz wifi router (like me) you need a channel of 11 or lower (so not 12 or 13), while for a 5GHz router 36, 40, 44, or 48 should be fine. \n\nI'm worried this will cause issues when travelling, even if just around town, but it hasn't affected me too badly yet. \n\n## Directories Show up as Files\n\nThis happens when the phone is connected via MTP, the most straightforward way to move files on and off.

It's a common problem; the most recent big one is the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/3457485) hack. My account was compromised as part of this, but I'm not very worried - Patreon had none of my payment information (since I pay through PayPal) and my password was a random assortment of characters that I don't use on any other sites. It wasn't hard to set this up, so I thought I'd explain what I do for passwords. \n\nI use a tool called [PasswordMaker](https://passwordmaker.org/). PasswordMaker is not a password manager - the passwords it generates are not stored anywhere, so I don't have to transfer files or worry about my password service getting hacked. PasswordMaker isn't even a company, it's just a method of generating passwords in a repeatable way. You configure initial settings like password length and possible character set (alphanumeric, symbols, etc.), and then use a master password and URL components (typically domain) to generate a password whenever you need to log into a site. PasswordMaker provides tools for all common browsers and phone operating systems.\n\nIn practice this is what I do with PasswordMaker:\n\n1. Go to a site's login page\n2. Open the PasswordMaker tool in my browser\n3. Enter my master password from memory\n4. PasswordMaker calculates my password for the site and puts it into the login form\n\nBecause PasswordMaker is not connected to the Internet, the master password stays just in my head, and each site I log into has a completely different password. \n\nIn this sense PasswordMaker is similar to the hashing algorithms any reasonable site uses to store passwords. A one-way hash is like the modulo function - `10 modulo 8 = 2` means divide ten by eight and take the remainder, leaving two. Because `2 modulo 8` and `18 modulo 8` are also 2 you can't tell what the original value was with just the hash. Hashing functions of the kind used to store passwords take text data as input and result into a pile of bytes which can be thought of as a really large number, so unlike the modulo example trying to come up with another input that hashes to the same thing is very hard. \n\nIn the case of PasswordMaker, it uses the mathematical properties of hash functions to do something like `(master password + site domain + optional extras) modulo ??? = site password` so you have a different password for every site without having to think about it.\n\nCases like the Patreon one are a little annoying because to change my password I need add an extra parameter, but most PasswordMaker clients support a list of domains to use special rules on. Some issues that have caused me to make exceptions for sites:\n\n- Site requires shorter passwords (limits of 16 or occasionally 8 characters)\n- Site doesn't allow punctuation (`*$%&,+-` etc.)\n- Site requires periodic change (fixed by adding an extra text field for new randomness)\n\nBetween that and using a credit card for online payments I don't have to worry about any particular site being hacked reaching out into other parts of my life, which is nice. \n\nSo, if you haven't done it yet, get yourself set up with [PasswordMaker](https://passwordmaker.org/), and if you have trouble feel free to contact me.

Also note that while it's\nnot explicitly clear from these diagrams, very few scenes depend on other\nscenes - this happens infrequently enough it's explained in the notes on the\nright. While every scene has notes, most are just a short scene description and\nwhat kind of LIPS encounter it is. Ψ\n"}

{"id":"8f5283fc","date":"2015-07-23T13:42:04.217Z","title":"Character Name Origins in Wachenroder","tags":["wachenroder","naming","published"],"parents":["ebb169b1"],"collections":"This post is part of a collection on <a href=\"/by-id/ebb169b1.html\">Wachenroder</a>.","rawBody":"\nOne interesting feature of Wachenroder is that almost none of the character\nnames are original - a variety of fictional works and real people were mined\nfor names, some quite obviously, some less so.  Here's an overview of the\ncharacters in the game and where their names come from. \n\nSpellings for names come from the cover of the Sega Official Guide Book where\navailable; the rest of the time I just guessed or paired them with their likely\norigins.\n\nWhile there's no single theme to the names, common sources are 19th century\nnovels in English, bands and musicians (mostly from the UK), or German culture. \n\n**Lucian Taylor:** The protagonist, a boy from the slums who becomes a\nmercenary to pay for his sister's medical treatment. This name is taken from\nthe protagonist of Arthur Machen's novel [The Hill of\nDreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_of_Dreams). \n\n**Carolyn (\"Carroll\") Mew:** An early ally who's not entirely honest about her\nbackground. Given the origins of the names of the other main characters,  the\nparticularlity of the spelling of \"Carroll\", and the resemblance of her\nheadgear to bunny ears, she seems to be named for [Lewis\nCarroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll). Fitting in with the\ntheme, \"Mew\" is the surname of another English author of the period, [Charlotte\nMew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Mew). \n\n**Titus Groan:** A bounty hunter on the run, he's the muscle for the party. His\nname comes from the central character of the\n[Gormenghast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gormenghast_%28series%29) series of\nnovels.\n\nThe next several characters form a troupe called the \"Travelling Performers,\nthe Chemical Brothers\", named after the\n[band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers). The troupe leader\nis simply called \"Chemical\". \n\n**Bellebete:** A blind singer who fights with a bow, she narrates the game to\nthe player. While a minor character in the story she's an important part of the\ngame's visual identity. Her name presumably comes from the band [Velvet\nRevolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolver). \n\n**Idle Lace:** A girl in a cat outfit with steam-powered brass knuckles. Her\nname comes from the English rock group [The Idle\nRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idle_Race). \n\n**Fatboy Slim:** A knife-throwing member of the Chemical Troupe, in-world his\nname comes from the inflatable suit he uses for defense. The source of his name\nis obviously [Fatboy Slim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Cook). \n\nThe next several characters are members of the \"Blow Monkeys\", a sort of\ninformal police force. The group name comes from a [UK rock\nband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blow_Monkeys). \n\n**Franky Zappa:** The rotund, armored leader of the Blow Monkeys, unrefined but\nprincipled. He is of course named after the\n[musician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa). \n\n**Small Faces:** A scout and sneaky member of the Blow Monkeys, and for much of\nthe game the only playable character with a gun. Named for an [English rock\nband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Faces)\n\n**Orange DX:** The technical expert in the group, he wears a knit hat and\nglasses and fights with a mortar. Named for the band [Orange\nDeluxe](http://www.bandplanet.co.uk/Oldsite/OrangeDeluxe.htm). \n\nThe next several characters are Imperial Swords, something like governors who\nreport directly to the King. There are five swords at any time, though as the\ngame opens one has been displaced as a wanted criminal. Unlike the characters\nabove, several of the Swords are never playable characters.\n\n**Durrenmatt:** The Sword on the run, while Lucian has sworn revenge on him and\nhe's initially mysterious and incredibly suspicious, he ends up proving an\ninvaluable ally to the main party. His name comes from Swiss author [Friedrich\nDurrenmatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_D%C3%BCrrenmatt). \n\n**Madame Leonore:** Sword of Sight, the city of pleasure and entertainment. Her\nname is probably a reference to Beethoven's only opera,\n[Fidelio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelio) (originally titled Leonore),\nwhose main character is also a skilled swordswoman.\n\n**George Koan:** Sword of Boat, the city of heavy industry, focusing on steel\nand weapons production.

Unfortunately\nsearching the katakana for his name directly overwhelmingly turns up a popular\nfan pairing for Suikoden II, so more investigation is needed. \n\n**Miss Leorme:** Sword of Cloud, the city of research and engineering. Her name\nis a reference to Italian band [Le\nOrme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Orme). \n\n**Benoit:** Sword of Cobalt, the agricultural city; an old man who rigidly\nfollows protocol. He is probably named for [St.\nBenedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_of_Nursia), called Benoit in\nFrench.\n\n**Holder Lin:** Sword of Mist, the city that supplies clean water to the\ncontinent, he displaced Durren.

His pale and vaguely\nvampiric look explain the \"Vlad\", and \"Rains\" is probably an allusion to his\nresearch causing bad weather and harmful rain on the continent.\n\n**G-Eazy:** A generic enemy soldier unit in the early game, named for a\n[rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Eazy). \n\n**Kikazaru, Mizaru, and Iwazaru:** These three bosses in the early game are\nnamed for the [three\nmonkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys). \n\n**Slapp Happy:** Early boss named for the [musical\ngroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapp_Happy). \n\n**Style Council:** Boss in the early middle game named for the [English\nband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Style_Council). \n\n**Anita Dekobra:** A mid-game boss fought on a train platform. \"Dekobra\" is the\ninvented surname of [Maurice\nDekobra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Dekobra), a very popular French\npulp author who was widely translated while alive.

His first appearance is as Lucian's opponent in a\n(non-interactive) pre-qualifying match for gladiatorial battles at the very\nstart of the story, and he doesn't appear again until much later, where the\nenemy has hired him and he's a level boss. The continent the game is set on is\nsurrounded by thick mist, and Vathek is the only character to have come from\noutside it - he lost his memories and is supposedly fighting to get them back\n(it's not clear why that makes any sense). Note that \"Caliph\" is used just as\npart of his name and not as a title. The name comes from a\n[novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vathek) about a decadent Caliph who meets\na bad end.\n\n**Walter Wanderley:** Vlad's most loyal and least sane servant, a late-game\nboss.

I have what I think is a near-optimal strategy I'll program later, but first I thought I'd write up the rules and how to play the game without the help of a computer. You'll need a deck of cards and a pencil and paper.\n\nThe game consists of several rounds of opposed bingo on 3x3 boards using hands of three cards. Each player starts with 15hp and the game is played until someone goes to zero or below, at which point they lose.\n\n## Set Up\n\nTake the cards and pull out the Ace-10 of Clubs, Hearts, and Spades; these represent 1-10, 11-20, and 21-30 respectively. \n\nTo track health you can use pencil and paper or use face cards as 5 health each and other cards as one point. \n\nTo generate your boards, take the 1-10 of Diamonds and deal three to each player. The first column of your board is these three cards sorted low to high going down. Repeat for the second and third columns. \n\nFinally, take the Clubs, Hearts, and Spades, shuffle them all together, deal three cards to each player and the game begins. \n\n## Play\n\nPlayers take turns playing cards. Each card corresponds to a position on the board - Clubs on the left, Hearts down the middle, and Spades on the right. Playing a card fills in that square on the board of whoever has it, or, if not on anyone's board it goes in the Dead Pile. Keep cards in the Dead Pile separated so they can be easily counted. \n\nThe game ends when either one board has three marked squares in a row (a BINGO) or the Dead Pile has five cards in it; playing the last card to the Dead Pile makes you lose, so watch out for that. \n\n## Scoring\n\nIn the case of a game that ended due to a win, the loser takes five points of damage for each BINGO and one point for each card in the Dead Pile.\n\nIn the case of a game ended by a full Dead Pile the loser (the person who played the fifth card) just takes five damage. \n\nThe next game should be played on fresh board, though using the same board is OK too. \n\n## Strategy\n\nThe game has a large element of luck which means that some hands will simply be unwinnable - if three cards representing either of your diagonals are at the bottom of the deck you have no chance of getting a BINGO. However, even if you can't win a hand there are good and bad ways to play it, and that's where the strategy comes in. \n\nNormally you need to win three times to beat your opponent, but by using the Dead Pile for extra damage you can beat them after only two rounds. If you see a quick BINGO it's often better to build up the Dead Pile before going in for the kill, though don't let your opponent form a BINGO first. The same goes for saving up for multiple BINGOs - a triple BINGO can win in one round!\n\nIf your opponent seems like they're about to BINGO or like they're building towards a multi-BINGO, filling up the Dead Pile on purpose can let you escape without taking too much damage. \n\nNot all squares on the BINGO board are equally valuable. While the center is obviously the best, the corners are better than the sides, which can only be part of two BINGOs. Remember that when you only have cards on your opponent's board. (Be careful about helping build a multi-BINGO though!)\n\nIf you've got plenty of health left and are building towards a multi-bingo, it may be better to fill in squares in your opponent's board rather than maxing out the dead pile, which could give them a relatively safe escape. \n\n## Going Forward\n\nThere are several things about these rules that I think could be improved.\n\n**Computer Assistance:** It'd be nice to be able to pull up a website to generate the boards and track HP for you. This should be pretty easy to throw together, though making it not fall asleep needs a bit of trickery I'm not used to.\n\n**HP Tweaking:** I think the current system of damage and the count of 15hp is OK, but tweaking the HP count to make Dead Pile use more important seems promising. \n\n**Powers:** The original LD idea involved each opponent having a special move. My original concept was changing the card value after your enemy played it (partly inspired by Dicenicks), but that causes issues with doubling up of cards that seem like too much trouble.

The technique is basically the same as the (now mostly broken) [Poe-based character generator](http://www.dampfkraft.com/gen/characters/poe.cgi) I wrote a few years ago. \n\nThe way it works is simple: first, using a part-of-speech tagger, pull all the nouns and adjectives out of a source document. Then, using [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu), sort the nouns into broad categories, in this case events, locations, items, and words that describe people. Create a fill-in-the-blank sentence with some adjectives in front of nouns of the right category and you've got MadLibs. \n\nThe fun thing about the technique is how authors are as distinctive as you'd expect; on top of that, since the method just uses lists of words, it's easy to mix things together so you can get, say, half Indiana Jones and half Lovecraft. \n\nI put an old version of the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/polm/chargen) a while back; I'm cleaning it up to be a little easier to use. Python's [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) helped make the tricky parts easy (though the POS tagging and sentence segmentation is really slow), but unfortunately there's nothing quite as mature in Javascript. While [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) has the WordNet part taken care of, [pos-js](https://github.com/fortnightlabs/pos-js) uses a single pre-trained tagger, so I need to test it to check the quality of the segmenter and tagger (both already problems in NLTK). Especially given that pos-js is semi-unmaintained it might make sense to just implement something from scratch. Of course, even if all those problems are worked out WordNet and a pre-trained tagger bring a lot of data to load into the browser for a one-off job. \n\nA much easier proposition is putting the pre-compiled list files online so they can be used to make generators; [Abulafia](http://random-generator.com) makes this easy, and I've gone ahead and added generators for [Lovecraft](http://random-generator.com/index.php?title=Lovecraft), [Leiber](http://random-generator.com/index.php?title=Leiber), and [Dunsany](http://random-generator.com/index.php?title=Lovecraft).

The technique is basically the same as the (now mostly broken) Poe-based character generator I wrote a few years ago.\nThe way it works is simple: first, using a part-of-speech tagger, pull all the nouns and adjectives out of a source document. Then, using WordNet, sort the nouns into broad categories, in this case events, locations, items, and words that describe people. Create a fill-in-the-blank sentence with some adjectives in front of nouns of the right category and you've got MadLibs.\nThe fun thing about the technique is how authors are as distinctive as you'd expect; on top of that, since the method just uses lists of words, it's easy to mix things together so you can get, say, half Indiana Jones and half Lovecraft.\nI put an old version of the code on GitHub a while back; I'm cleaning it up to be a little easier to use. Python's NLTK helped make the tricky parts easy (though the POS tagging and sentence segmentation is really slow), but unfortunately there's nothing quite as mature in Javascript. While natural has the WordNet part taken care of, pos-js uses a single pre-trained tagger, so I need to test it to check the quality of the segmenter and tagger (both already problems in NLTK). Especially given that pos-js is semi-unmaintained it might make sense to just implement something from scratch. Of course, even if all those problems are worked out WordNet and a pre-trained tagger bring a lot of data to load into the browser for a one-off job.\nA much easier proposition is putting the pre-compiled list files online so they can be used to make generators; Abulafia makes this easy, and I've gone ahead and added generators for Lovecraft, Leiber, and Dunsany. If there's any other author I should toss up, do tell me.\nBesides that the next thing to do is make a Japanese version - since Mecab and Japanese Wordnet are both relatively easy to use that'll actually be easier than a web port.

That's kind of what [Red Dragon](http://sai-zen-sen.jp/special/reddragon/) is, except instead of D&D it uses a homebrew system and the authors are best known for light novels, anime, and visual novels. \n\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/M3u54joR5lw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\"Replays\" are cleaned-up tabletop RPG transcripts that share a number of publishing conventions with light novels. They've been around almost as long as RPGs in Japan, growing out of the \"how to play an RPG\" guide into a niche of their own. Red Dragon is a bit different than most in that the players are pretty high profile: [Urobuchi Gen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Urobuchi), [Kinoko Nasu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinoko_Nasu), and [Narita Ryohgo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryohgo_Narita) are all in the game. Additionally, very few replay series have a full art team, promotional videos, original soundtracks, or fully-featured free online versions. \n\nRPG war stories are popular anywhere; [Blaize O'Glory's Post-Mortem Hall of Fame](http://users.tellurian.com/dano/hallfame.html) is a series of tales from the early days of the Internet, and these days there's a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/) on the topic, besides any number of campaign blogs. The transcript style isn't popular (though there are [examples](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/15565/where-can-i-find-transcripts-of-actual-game-sessions)) and the few dips into commercial publication are all fictionalized accounts like [Dragonlance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance).\n\nReplays aren't necessarily better than fictionalized versions; they depend a lot on the table dynamic between the players and can require knowledge of the rules that a novel would smooth over. That being the case, besides being easier to produce they can also function as advice on running a game in a more direct and convincing way than most Game Mastering tips.

The individual characters are a little strange, though - the first is given by [the dictionary](http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E8%9C%83) as \"clam\" while the last is \"multi-story building\". According to the [Japanese Wikipedia article on mirages](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%9C%83%E6%B0%97%E6%A5%BC) the etymology of the word lies in a Chinese myth of a kind of clam whose breath created illusory cities.
